 * @brief Fitness Proportional Selection strategy
 *
 * @details
 * This selection strategy selects individuals for reproduction based on their fitness.
 * Individuals with higher fitness have a higher probability of being selected.
 * This strategy is also known as roulette wheel selection.
 *
 * The calculation of fitnesses is done such that all fitness values are in the range
 * [0, +infinity]. Therefore, the selection probabilities are simply calculated by
 * dividing each fitness value by the sum of all fitness values.
