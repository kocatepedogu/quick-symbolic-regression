     * @brief Performs a pre-order traversal on the expression's tree to choose a subtree

     * @param target The pre-order index of the chosen subtree's root node
     *
     * @details
     * Every expression has a `num_of_nodes` value, which is computed during the construction of expressions.
     * Terminals (constants, variables, weights) have a num_of_nodes value of one.
     * Others have a num_of_nodes value equal to the sum of nodes in their operand(s), plus one.
     *
     * The `pick` method declared above (the public one) generates a random integer in the range `[0, num_of_nodes - 1]`.
     * The chosen integer is substituted into the `target` argument of this method, which traverses
     * the tree until the pre-order index of the current node (the parameter `current`) equals `target`.
     *
     * This is to ensure that a subtree can be selected with no bias with respect to the
     * overall tree structure.
