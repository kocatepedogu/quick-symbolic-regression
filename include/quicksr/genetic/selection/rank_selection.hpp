/**
 * @brief Rank Selection strategy
 *
 * @details
 * This selection strategy selects individuals for reproduction based on their rank.
 * Individuals are first sorted based on their fitness, and the selection probability is
 * determined by their order in the sorted array.
 *
 * The calculation of selection probabilities is done by the formula
 * \[
 * P(i) = \frac{1}{n} \left(1 + sp \left(1 - \frac{2(i-1)}{n-1}\right)\right)
 * \]
 * where \( i \) is the rank of the individual, \( n \) is the population size, and \( sp \) is the selection pressure.
 *
 * The `sp` parameter (selection pressure) controls the steepness of the selection curve.
