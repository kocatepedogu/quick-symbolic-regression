/**
 * @brief Point mutation strategy
 *
 * @details
 * This mutation strategy randomly selects a node in the expression.
 *
 * If the selected node is a terminal (constant, variable, parameter), it is replaced 
 * by another randomly generated terminal.
 *
 * If the selected node is a unary operation (sin, cos, exp, relu), it is replaced by another randomly 
 * chosen unary operation, while its sole operand (child) is preserved.
 *
 * If the selected node is a binary operation (+, -, *, /), it is replaced by another randomly 
 * selected binary operation, while both of its operands (children) are preserved.
 *
 * This strategy explores new functions without growth in the complexity of the expressions.
 *
 * @param mutation_probability The probability of applying the mutation to an individual.
